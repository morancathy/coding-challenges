/*Given two non-empty arrays of integers(numbers), write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that arenâ€™t necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers [1,3,4] form a subsequence of the array [1,2,3,4], and so do the numbers [2,4]. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.( [1],[2],[3],[4]and [1,2,3,4] are all valid subsequences of [1,2,3,4] )*/

	let counter = 0;

    //loop through array, compaire array to sequence array
	for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
		let num = array[i];

        //if array element === sequence element, increase counter
